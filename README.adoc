## Sonar Cloud code analysis

The projet is analyzed on SonarCloud on each pull request and after each push on master.  You can find the SonarCloud project page : link:https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=Chelxb_fizz-buzz-ws[here]. +
For the time being the quality gate is the Sonar default. It would be modified, should the need arise.

## Requirements

To develop or compile the application you need :

* Java Development Kit 17 or newer
* Maven 3.8.6 or newer

Optionally to run the container locally :

* Docker

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run the application in dev mode which enables live coding using:

```shell script
mvn quarkus:dev
```

To access the Quarkus Dev UI, go to http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
mvn package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. The dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.
